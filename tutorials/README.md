# Tutorials

This directory contains walkthroughs and example workflows for exploring and analyzing graph-based models used in the **retire** study.

---

## Overview

These tutorials demonstrate how to:
1. **Build and filter graph models** using `thema.multiverse` utilities.  
2. **Explore** graph outputs with the interactive visualization framework `Explore`.  
3. Access and analyze data directly from the **retire** study.  
4. Replicate and understand figures and results included in the manuscript.

## [Manuscript Directory](https://github.com/Krv-Analytics/retire/tree/1-reproducibility-pipeline/manuscript)

The [`/manuscript` directory](https://github.com/Krv-Analytics/retire/tree/1-reproducibility-pipeline/manuscript) contains:
- Direct replication notebooks for all figures and analyses in the paper.
- Supporting data and figure exports.

## Notes

- All tutorials are designed for **exploration and understanding**, not heavy computation.  
- Full, high-density grid searches and analyses (as used in the paper) can be replicated from `/manuscript` for completeness.  
- For new domains or datasets, customize filters and heuristics to match your data scale and objectives.
